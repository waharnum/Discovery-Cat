###Development

Follow these steps -

1. Open node cli and run `npm install`.
2. Use `grunt dev` in cli. This will do the following-
  - Start a server at `http://localhost:8000`.
  - Keeps watching files for changes.
  - Perform livereload on saves.
  - Run jshint and jscs on saves.

####Possible grunt operations

1. `grunt lint` - performs linting ( both jshint and jscs) seperately.
2. `grunt jshint` - uses jshint to analyse code for potential errors.
3. `grunt jscs` - uses jscs for codestyle linting.
